# E-Mensa_Werbeseite
This is an example of e-cantine based on MVC architecture model written on php, html and css expanded with blade templating engine also supported by MariaDB database. 
This website is a simulation of a simple-to-use digital cantine, where the user can login, see, give, change grades and captions for each meal,
see how many people gave grades. Simpler version of it, which is not written on MVC also allows visitors of the page to see how many meals are there,
how many people visited the page and gives an opportunity to register for the newsletter.
